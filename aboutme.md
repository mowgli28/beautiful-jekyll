- History of Real Estate experience.
- Asset Management for Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac
- Licensed Real estate agent for 6 years+


Hi, I'm ZacQuary Lincoln, a Data Scientist focused on innovative and revolutionary technology 
for today's day and age as well as the future years. I began managing the reoccuring and non recurring 
properties the banks owned through the notorious 2008 real estate crash. I was the regional foreman
for the northern San Diego County. 

I started my real estate career selling high-end real esate in The Coachella Valley and later 
moved on to the Los Angeles area working for The Valerie Fitzgerald Group in Beverly Hills. The experience
gained working here was an invalualbe point of time in my life. I was able to connect and network with 
a lot of key people in specific industries many owners or top executives of very successful companies. 

### 
Was able to apply the knowledge I've receieved through the experiences I have been through
to express conceptual designs for proprietary software development applications which could
not only have a positive societal influence, but will have a positive impact for future work in 
a sector of the markets effecting multiple industries.

###
I believe autonomous systems are going to revolutionize day to day life for all of humanity,
and accurate and growing databases are extremely important in creating efficient systems
altering our daily life. The more information you have on individuals the better suggestions
a computer could make recommendations.
